LIMITAÇÃO DOS DADOS
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008410117:
Numbers of deaths may be more reliable than the numbers of cases (asymptomatic cases, availability and sensitivity of diagnostic tests, overwhelmed and unpreparedhealth systems/surveilance fatigue). media reports sugest consistent underreporting of COVID-19 deaths globally.

PAÍSES PEQUENOS
https://peerj.com/articles/10112/#p-8
In smaller states (i.e., <0.5 million inhabitants), the rate of erroneous identification of COVID-19 deaths may be particularly high due to the lack of expertise, measuring devices and experience. Moreover, in such microstates small absolute changes in COVID-19 deaths may result in extreme values of relative indices
