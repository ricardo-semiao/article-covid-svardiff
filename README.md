## Abstract
Finding evidence for the effectiveness of COVID vaccines is very important to guide the action of policymakers, especially considering how recent the pandemic is. This thesis contributes to literature by using an SVAR, motivated by and identifyed by a SIR epidemiological model. The capture of temporal dynamics between variables, the relaxation of assumptions on infection, mortality, and vaccination rates constant over time, as well as the potential of generating different types of results are this methodâ€™s main benefits. It was discovered that the response of deaths to a shock of 1000 cases was 81\% (or 18.21, in absolute terms) less than after the inclusion of vaccines. There was also an analysis of counterfactuals, indicating that the number of lives saved goes from \textit{lower bound} of 31 thousand to a \textit{upper bound} of 281 thousand (but there is indication that this band is substantially less wide).
